## API Usage and Examples

In the following sections, we'll demonstrate the API usage with examples using the API server that is running on Pittsburgh Super Computing. The API base URI is https://ccd4.vm.bridges.psc.edu/ccd-api.

This API requires user to be authenticated. Before using this API, the user will need to go to [Causal-Web App](https://ccd4.vm.bridges.psc.edu/ccd/) and create an account. 

### Getting JSON Web Token(JWT)

After registration in Causal Web App, the email and password can be used to authenticate against the Causal REST API to get the access token (we use JWT) via **HTTP Basic Auth**. 

API Endpoint URI pattern:

````
GET https://ccd4.vm.bridges.psc.edu/ccd-api/jwt
````

In basic auth, the user provides the username and password, which the HTTP client concatenates (username + ":" + password), and base64 encodes it. This encoded string is then sent using a `Authorization` header with the "Basic" schema. For instance user email `demo@pitt.edu` whose password is `123`.

````
POST /ccd-api/jwt HTTP/1.1
Host: ccd4.vm.bridges.psc.edu
Authorization: Basic ZGVtb0BwaXR0LmVkdToxMjM=
````

Once the request is processed successfully, the user ID together with a JWT will be returned in the response for further API queries.

````
{
  "userId": 22,
  "jwt": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2Nsb3VkLmNjZC5waXR0LmVkdS8iLCJuYW1lIjoiemh5MTkiLCJleHAiOjE0NzU4NTA0Mjg1OTcsImlhdCI6MTQ3NTg0NjgyODU5N30.FcE7aEpg0u2c-gUVugIjJkzjhlDu5qav_XHtgLu3c6E",
  "issuedTime": 1475846828597,
  "lifetime": 3600,
  "expireTime": 1475850428597,
  "wallTime": [
    1,
    3,
    6
  ]
}
````

We'll need to use this `userId` in the URI path of all subsequent requests. And this `jwt` expires in 3600 seconds(1 hour), so the API consumer will need to request for another JWT otherwise the API query to other API endpoints will be denied. And this JWT will need to be sent via the HTTP `Authorization` header as well, but using the `Bearer` schema.

The `wallTime` field is designed for users who want to specify the the maximum CPU time when Slurm handles the jobs on PSC. Normally, a job is expected to finish before the specified maximum walltime.  After the walltime reaches the maximum, the job terminates regardless whether the job processes are still running or not. In this example, you can pick 1 hour, 3 or 6 hours as the wallTime.

Note: querying the JWT endpoint again before the current JWT expires will generate a new JWT, which makes the old JWT expired automatically. And this newly generated JWT will be valid in another hour unless there's another new JWT being queried.

Since this API is developed with Jersey, which supports [WADL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language). So you can view the generated WADL by going to `https://ccd4.vm.bridges.psc.edu/ccd-api/application.wadl?detail=true` and see all resource available in the application. Accessing to this endpoint doesn't require authentication.

Basically, all the API usage examples are grouped into three categories: 

1. Data Management
2. Causal Discovery
3. Result Management

And all the following examples will be issued by user `22` whose password is `123`.

### 1. Data Management

#### Upload small data file

At this point, you can upload two types of data files: tabular dataset file(either tab delimited or comma delimited) and prior knowledge file.

API Endpoint URI pattern:

````
POST https://ccd4.vm.bridges.psc.edu/ccd-api/{userId}/dataset/upload
````

This is a multipart file upload via an HTML form, and the client is required to use `name="file"` to name their file upload field in their form.

Generated HTTP request code example:

````
POST /ccd-api/22/dataset/upload HTTP/1.1
Host: ccd4.vm.bridges.psc.edu
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2Nsb3VkLmNjZC5waXR0LmVkdS8iLCJuYW1lIjoiemh5MTkiLCJleHAiOjE0NzU4NTA2NzY4MDQsImlhdCI6MTQ3NTg0NzA3NjgwNH0.8azVEoNPfETczXb-vn7dfyDd98eRt7iiLBXehGpPGzY
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW

----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename=""
Content-Type: 


----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
````

If the Authorization header is not provided, the response will look like this:

````javascript
{
  "timestamp": 1465414501443,
  "status": 401,
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "User credentials are required.",
  "path": "/22/dataset/upload"
}
````

This POST request will upload the dataset file to the target server location and add corresponding records into database. And the response will contain the following pieces:

````javascript
{
    "id": 6,
    "name": "Lung-tetrad_hv.txt",
    "creationTime": 1466622267000,
    "lastModifiedTime": 1466622267000,
    "fileSize": 3309465,
    "md5checkSum": "b1db7511ee293d297e3055d9a7b46c5e",
    "fileSummary": {
      "variableType": null,
      "fileDelimiter": null,
      "numOfRows": null,
      "numOfColumns": null
    }
  }
````

The prior knowledge file upload uses a similar API endpoint:

````
POST https://ccd4.vm.bridges.psc.edu/ccd-api/{userId}/priorknowledge/upload
````

Due to there's no need to summarize a prior knowledge file, the response of a successful prior knowledge file upload will look like:


````javascript
{
    "id": 6,
    "name": "Lung-tetrad_hv.txt",
    "creationTime": 1466622267000,
    "lastModifiedTime": 1466622267000,
    "fileSize": 3309465,
    "md5checkSum": "ugdb7511rt293d29ke3055d9a7b46c9k"
  }
````

#### Resumable data file upload

In addition to the regular file upload described in Example 6, we also provide the option of stable and resumable large file upload. It requires the client side to have a resumable upload implementation. We currently support client integrated with [Resumable.js](http://resumablejs.com/), whihc provides multiple simultaneous, stable 
and resumable uploads via the HTML5 File API. You can also create your own client as long as al the following parameters are set correctly.

API Endpoint URI pattern:

````
GET https://ccd4.vm.bridges.psc.edu/ccd-api/{userId}/chunkupload

POST https://ccd4.vm.bridges.psc.edu/ccd-api/{userId}/chunkupload
````

In this example, the data file is splited into 3 chunks. The upload of each chunk consists of a GET request and a POST request. To handle the state of upload chunks, a number of extra parameters are sent along with all requests:

* `resumableChunkNumber`: The index of the chunk in the current upload. First chunk is `1` (no base-0 counting here).
* `resumableChunkSize`: The general chunk size. Using this value and `resumableTotalSize` you can calculate the total number of chunks. Please note that the size of the data received in the HTTP might be lower than `resumableChunkSize` of this for the last chunk for a file.
* `resumableCurrentChunkSize`: The size of the current resumable chuck.
* `resumableTotalSize`: The total file size.
* `resumableType`: The file type of the resumable chuck, e.e., "text/plain".
* `resumableIdentifier`: A unique identifier for the file contained in the request.
* `resumableFilename`: The original file name (since a bug in Firefox results in the file name not being transmitted in chunk multipart posts).
* `resumableRelativePath`: The file's relative path when selecting a directory (defaults to file name in all browsers except Chrome).
* `resumableTotalChunks`: The total number of chunks.  

Generated HTTP request code example:

````

````

This GET request checks if the data chunk is already on the server side. If the target file chunk is not found on the server, the client will issue a POST request to upload the actual data.

Each chunk upload POST will get a 200 status code from response if everything works fine.


And finally the md5checkSum string of the reassemabled file will be returned once the whole file has been uploaded successfully. In this example, the POST request that uploads the third chunk will response this:

````

Form the above output, we can also tell that data file with ID 10 doesn't have all the `fileSummary` field values set, we'll cover this in the dataset summarization section.

#### Get the detail information of a dataset file based on ID

API Endpoint URI pattern:

````
GET https://ccd4.vm.bridges.psc.edu/ccd-api/{userId}/dataset/{id}
````

Generated HTTP request code example:

````
GET /ccd-api/22/dataset/8 HTTP/1.1
Host: ccd4.vm.bridges.psc.edu
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2Nsb3VkLmNjZC5waXR0LmVkdS8iLCJuYW1lIjoiemh5MTkiLCJleHAiOjE0NzU4NTA2NzY4MDQsImlhdCI6MTQ3NTg0NzA3NjgwNH0.8azVEoNPfETczXb-vn7dfyDd98eRt7iiLBXehGpPGzY
````

And the resulting response looks like this:

````json
{
  "id": 8,
  "name": "data_small.txt",
  "creationTime": 1467132449000,
  "lastModifiedTime": 1467132449000,
  "fileSize": 278428,

    "variableType": "continuous",
    "fileDelimiter": "tab",
    "numOfRows": 302,
    "numOfColumns": 123
  }
}
````

#### Delete physical dataset file and all records from database for a given file ID

API Endpoint URI pattern:

````
DELETE https://ccd4.vm.bridges.psc.edu/ccd-api/{userId}/dataset/{id}
````

Generated HTTP request code example:

````
DELETE /ccd-api/22/dataset/8 HTTP/1.1
Host: ccd4.vm.bridges.psc.edu
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2Nsb3VkLmNjZC5waXR0LmVkdS8iLCJuYW1lIjoiemh5MTkiLCJleHAiOjE0NzU4NTA2NzY4MDQsImlhdCI6MTQ3NTg0NzA3NjgwNH0.8azVEoNPfETczXb-vn7dfyDd98eRt7iiLBXehGpPGzY
````

And this will result a HTTP 204 No Content status in response on success, which means the server successfully processed the deletion request but there's no content to response.


#### Summarize dataset file

So from the first example we can tell that file with ID 10 doesn't have `variableType`, `fileDelimiter`, `numOfRows`, and `numOfColumns` specified under `fileSummary`. Among these attributes, variableType` and `fileDelimiter` are the ones that users will need to provide during this summarization process.

Before we can go ahead to run the desired algorithm with the newly uploaded data file, we'll need to summarize the data by specifing the variable type and file delimiter.

| Required Fields | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | The data file ID |
| `variableType` | continuous, discrete, mixed |
| `fileDelimiter` | tab or comma |

API Endpoint URI pattern:

````
POST https://ccd4.vm.bridges.psc.edu/ccd-api/{userId}/dataset/summarize
````

Generated HTTP request code example:

````
POST /ccd-api/22/dataset/summarize HTTP/1.1

Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": 1,
    "variableType": "continuous",
    "fileDelimiter": "comma"
}
````

This POST request will summarize the dataset file and generate a response (JSON or XML) like below:

        "description": "BPC (Build Pure Clusters) searches for causal structure over latent variables, where the true models are Multiple Indicator Models (MIM’s). The idea is this. There is a set of latent (unmeasured) variables over which a directed acyclic model has been defined. Then for each of these latent L there are 3 (preferably 4) or more measures of that variable—that is, measured variables that are all children of L. Under these conditions, one may define tetrad constraints (see Spirtes et al., 2000). There is a theorem to the effect that if certain patterns of these tetrad constraints hold, there must be a latent common cause of all of them (the Tetrad Representation Theorem, see Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines (1993), where the BPC (“Build Pure Clusters”) algorithm is defined and discussed.) Moreover, once one has such a “measurement model,” once can estimate a covariance matrix over the latent variables that are parents of the measures and use some algorithm such as PC or GES to estimate a pattern over the latents. The algorithm to run PC or GES on this covariance matrix is called MimBuild (“MIM” is the the graph, Multiple Indicator Model; “Build” means build). In this way, one may recover causal structure over the latents. The more measures one has for each latent, the better the result is, generally. The larger the sample size the better. One important issue is that the algorithm is sensitive to so-called “impurities”—that is, causal edges among the measured variables, or between measured variables and unintended latent. The algorithm will in effect remove one measure in each impure pair from consideration.\n\nInput Assumptions: Continuous data, a collection of measurements in the above sense, excluding the latent variables (which are to be learned).\n\nOutput Format: For BPC, a measurement model, in the above sense. This is represented as a clustering of variables; it may be inferred that there is a single latent for each output cluster. For MimBuild, a pattern over the latent variables, one for each cluster.\n\nParameters: \n- Cutoff for p-values (alpha). Conditional independence tests with p-values greater\nthan this will be judged to be independent (H0). Default 0.01.\n- Yes if the Wishart test should be used. No if the Delta test should be used.

The basic idea is to build up clusters one at a time by adding variables that keep them pure, in the sense that all relevant tetrad constraints still hold. There are different ways of going about this. One could try to build one cluster up as far as possible, then remove all of those variables from the set, and try to make a another cluster using the remaining variables (SAG, i.e., Seed and Grow). Or one can try in parallel to grow all possible clusters and then choose among the grown clusters using some criterion such as cluster size (GAP, Grow and Pick). In general, GAP is more accurate. The result is a clustering of variables.

In this example, we are running the "FGES" algorithm with "BDeu Test" and "BDeu Score" on the file of ID 8. We also set the wallTime as 1 hour. And this call will return the job info with a 201 Created response status code.

````

    "errorResultFileName": "error_fges_Retention.txt_1515617400499.txt"
}
````

From this response we can tell that the job ID is 25, and the result file name will be `fges_Retention.txt_1515617400499.txt` if everything goes well. If something is wrong an error result file with name `error_fges_Retention.txt_1515617400499.txt` will be created.


#### List all running jobs

API Endpoint URI pattern:

````
GET https://ccd4.vm.bridges.psc.edu/ccd-api/{userId}/jobs

Content-Type: application/json

````

Then you'll see the information of all jobs that are currently running:

````javascript
[
  {
    "id": 32,
    "algoId": "fges",
    "addedTime": 1468436085000

    "algoId": "gfci",
    "addedTime": 1468436087000
  }
]
````

#### Check the job status for a given job ID

Once the new job is submitted, it takes time and resources to run the algorithm on the server. During the waiting, you can check the status of a given job ID:

API Endpoint URI pattern:

````
GET https://ccd4.vm.bridges.psc.edu/ccd-api/{userId}/jobs/{id}
````

Generated HTTP request code example:

````
GET /ccd-api/22/jobs/32 HTTP/1.1

This will either return "Pending" or "Completed".

#### Cancel a running job

Sometimes you may want to cancel a submitted job.

API Endpoint URI pattern:

````

#### Compare algorithm result files

Since we can list all the algorithm result files, based on the results, we can also choose multiple files and run a comparison. 

API Endpoint URI pattern:

````
POST https://ccd4.vm.bridges.psc.edu/ccd-api/{userId}/results/compare
````

The request body is a JSON that contains an array of result files to be compared.

    "FGESc_data_small.txt_1467305104859.txt"
  ]
}
````
When you specify multiple file names, use the `!!` as a delimiter. This request will generate a result comparison file with the following content (shortened version):

````
fges_sim_data_20vars_100cases.csv_1466171729046.txt	fges_data_small.txt_1467305104859.txt
